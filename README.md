📌 Overview

This project implements a real-world microservices architecture using:

🌐 Public API Gateway

🔐 Private Microservices

🔑 Auth0 JWT Authentication

⚙️ Spring Cloud Config Server

🔍 Eureka Server

🔗 Internal REST communication

🛡️ Zero Trust Security Model

All requests must go through API Gateway, and every microservice validates the JWT again.
</p>
🧩 Microservices Included
1️⃣ User Service

✔ Manages user info
✔ Validates JWT
✔ Registered with Eureka
✔ Config fetched from Config Server
✔ Calls Hotel + Rating internally

2️⃣ Hotel Service

✔ Manages hotel data
✔ Communicates with Rating + User services
✔ Token validation using Auth0 JWT converter

3️⃣ Rating Service

✔ Stores user ratings
✔ Aggregates rating data for hotels
✔ Calls Hotel/User microservices internally

4️⃣ API Gateway (Only Public Component)

✔ Validates JWT
✔ Forwards token downstream
✔ Uses Eureka for routing
✔ No business logic

5️⃣ Eureka Server

✔ Registers all services
✔ Enables dynamic routing
✔ Ensures scalability

6️⃣ Spring Cloud Config Server

✔ Centralized configuration
✔ Backend Git repository
✔ Serves configs to:

→ User Service

→ Hotel Service

→ Rating Service

→ Gateway

→ Eureka Server

🔐 Authentication Flow (Auth0 JWT)
Client → Auth0 → Receives JWT  
Client → API Gateway (JWT validated)
Gateway → Specific Microservice (JWT validated again)
Microservices ↔ Internal Communication


✔ Microservices are private
✔ Gateway is public
✔ All internal traffic secured

🌐 End-to-End Request Flow
✔ Client → Auth0 (Login, JWT)
✔ Client → API Gateway (Authorize)
✔ Gateway → Eureka (Find Service)
✔ Gateway → User/Hotel/Rating (Forward)
✔ Microservices ↔ Microservices (Internal Calls)

🛠️ Technology Stack

✔ Authentication	Auth0 (JWT / OIDC)
✔ Gateway	Spring Cloud API Gateway
✔ Service Registry	Eureka Server
✔ Configurations	Spring Cloud Config

  → hotel-service.yml
  → rating-service.yml
  → api-gateway.yml
  → eureka-server.yml

🚀 Running the Project (Local Setup)
1️⃣ Start Config Server
cd config-server
mvn spring-boot:run

2️⃣ Start Eureka
cd eureka-server
mvn spring-boot:run

3️⃣ Start Microservices
cd user-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd hotel-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd rating-service && mvn spring-boot:run

4️⃣ Start Gateway
cd api-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run

🧪 Testing the APIs

➡️ Every request must include an Auth0 access token

- Postman → Authorization → Bearer Token

- Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>


Example:

GET http://localhost:8083/hotels/1

🔒 Production Notes

✔ Gateway is Public
✔ Microservices Private
✔ JWT validated at Gateway + Microservices
✔ Zero-Trust Architecture
✔ Centralized Git-backed configuration

✨ Features Demonstrated
